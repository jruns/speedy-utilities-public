## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why is this plugin free?

Because websites should be fast without costing money.

### Why is this plugin not publicly available?

I have come to the realization that most Open Source software is created without thinking of how it will be used, and how it can be used for something bad. And I cannot condone my work being used by an organization or individual who wants to hurt people, animals, or the planet.

### How can I share this plugin with like-minded organizations or individuals?

Please have them contact [jason.runs@proton.me](mailto:jason.runs@proton.me) with a description of their organization or website purpose. They will be provided with an installation file if their values align.
